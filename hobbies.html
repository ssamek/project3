	  <h2>Drawing/Painting</h2>
	  <p>I enjoy making art of any kind, but in particular I enjoy drawing and painting. The main subjects of my art are people. I enjoy drawing people and creating characters. The main supplies/ medias that I use include pencil/graphite drawings, watercolor paints, and ink. I have been creating art since the age of 6 years old and I have grown to enjoy it more and more.</p>

	  <h2>Photography</h2>
	  <p>Another interest/hobby of mine is photography. I took a photography class in high school and fell in love with capturing images. I typically take pictures of nature and flowers because I find that this is the most beautiful thing to photograph.</p>

	<section id="games">
	  <h2>Video Games</h2>
	  <p>I enjoy playing video games even though I don't have a lot of time to play them. My favorite games include Valorant, Overwatch and Minecraft because those are games I can play with my friends. I do enjoy single player games too, such as GRIS or Bear and Breakfast, but I prefer playing with friends.</p>
